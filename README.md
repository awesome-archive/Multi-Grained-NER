# Usage

Step 0.0, Prepare Data

 -- Get Datasets: The dataset content is subject to copyright issues. 

    Some useful pointers:

    (ACE 2004) https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2005T09

    (ACE 2005) https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2006T06

    (CoNLL 2003) https://cogcomp.seas.upenn.edu/page/resource_view/81


-- Extract data and preprocess the dataset into the required data format.

    Two types of format are needed.
    
    The first example can be found at data/ace2004/train.txt.
    
    The second examples can be found at data/ace2004/elmo/sentences/train_sentences.
     
    Please generate formated files for the whole datasets.
    
    Replace the example files with your generated files, including:
    
    data/ace2004/train.txt
    
    data/ace2004/test.txt
    
    data/ace2004/dev.txt
    
    data/ace2004/elmo/sentences/train_sentences
    
    data/ace2004/elmo/sentences/test_sentences
    
    data/ace2004/elmo/sentences/dev_sentences


-- Word embeddings: 

    Download glove.6B.zip from https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/. 

    Unzip it and put glove.6B.300d.txt under the directory of data/glove.6B/


-- Elmo embeddings: 

     cd data/ace2004/elmo
     sh run.sh
 
 Run the script to download Elmo embeddings.
  
 Three files should be generated:
 
    elmo_dev.hdf5
 
    elmo_test.hdf5
 
    elmo_train.hdf5 
 
 
 
Step 1.0, Enter the detector directory and follow the README file

  Step 1.1, data preprocessing

  ```
  cd detector
  python build_data.py
  ```
  It should generate files including ``glove.6B.300d.trimmed.npz, chars.txt, tags.txt and words.txt'' under data

  Step 1.2, train detector
 
  ```
  python train.py
  ```

  Step 1.3, dump shared features
  
  ```
  python dump.py
  ```

  If you'd like to evaluate the performance of the Detector, please run the evaluate.py
  
  ```
  python evaluate.py
  ```

Step 2.0, Enter the classifier directory and follow the README file

  Step 2.1, train classifier
  
  ```
  python train.py
  ```

  Step 2.2, evaluate model performance
  
  ```
  python evaluate.py
  ```
